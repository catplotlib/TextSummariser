# Text Summariser
There are three python files in this repository:
1. EX_final.ipynb: Has the code for an Extractive Summarisation Technique that uses a pre-trained Glove model with 100-dimensional word vectors to create the sentence vectors, and it uses the sent_tokenize function from the NLTK package to tokenize the text into sentences.
2. AB_final.ipynb:Has the code for an Abstractive Summarisation Technique that uses a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) encoder-decoder architecture to generate text.
3. BART_final.ipynb: Has the usage of a pretrained code for an Abstractive Summarisation Technique that uses the pre-trained T5 model to generate a summary of the input text.
